## Example of restraints
# nfunctions    = 2         # number of functions
#
# function1     = POSI      # restraint function type
# direction1    = ALL       # direction [ALL,X,Y,Z]
# constant1     = 10.0      # force constant
# select_index1 = 1         # restrained groups
#
# function2     = DIST      # restraint function type
# constant2     = 10.0 10.0 # force constants
# reference2    = 5.5 6.0   # references
# select_index2 = 2 3 4 5   # restrained groups
